Change My Record
===========================

A tool to help Californians reclassify eligible low-level, nonviolent felonies as misdemeanors on their criminal records, per [Proposition 47](http://myprop47.org).

The official petition process varies from county to county and presents a host of challenges:
 1. Which forms does my county use? (There are more than 50 of them!)
 2. How do I get the form? Do I need to go to the courthouse in person during the day (i.e., take time off of work or arrange childcare)? If I download the form online, where will I use a printer and how much will postage cost?
 3. What do the form fields mean?
 4. Which fields do I actually need to fill out? Which should I leave blank?
 5. Where do I need to send the form?
 6. What should I expect to happen next?

Change My Record dramatically simplifies the process, asking you only the necessary questions and removing the need to print or scan anything or visit a courthouse. Just fill out the simple online form, click 'Submit,' and your application is on its way to the appropriate destination.

You see a user-friendly form. County officials get the same exact form they're used to. With Change My Record, submitting a petition takes less time than ordering a pizza and you can do it from any computer or touchscreen phone.
