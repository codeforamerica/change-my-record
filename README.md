# Medi-CalFresh and So Clean

Making applying for Medi-Cal not suck.

# @todo: Update the below. (Currently it's verbatim from Dave Guarino's CalFresh and So Clean.)

## How it sucks now

## What's this?

A user-friendly web form with the minimal fields necessary that generates a PDF application and faxes it in to HSA.

## Setup

The script is a proof of concept, and has a few dependencies:

- Ruby
- The `pdf-forms` gem ( https://github.com/jkraemer/pdf-forms )
- `pdftk` utility (on Debian-like systems, install via `apt-get install pdftk`)

The script is being developed on Ubuntu 14, and so might need to be modified for other environments.

For faxing capabilities, set the following environment variables:

- PHAXIO_API_KEY
- PHAXIO_API_SECRET
- FAX_DESTINATION_NUMBER

## SSL

If `RACK_ENV` is set to anything other than the default (`development`) then all unencrypted HTTP requests will be redirected to their HTTPS equivalents.

Put another way: when developing locally, you should be good to go. If you're deploying, you will need to configure SSL (works by default on Heroku if you're using their default XXX.herokuapp.com domain for your app).

## Deployment to Heroku

```bash
heroku create YOURAPPNAMEGOESHERE
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
git push heroku master
heroku config:set PATH=/app/bin:/app/vendor/bundle/bin:/app/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.1.0/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/app/vendor/pdftk/bin
heroku config:set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/app/vendor/pdftk/lib
```
